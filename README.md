# Multilevel-Cache-Simulator-with-Prefetch
A C++ simulator for L1/L2 cache levels with a configurable stream-buffer prefetch unit, implementing the WBWA policy. Simulates cache performance with varying size, associativity, and block size using SPEC 2006/2007 benchmarks. Analyzes cache configurations to optimize microprocessor architecture performance.
